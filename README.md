## What is Ceasar Tracker ?

Ceasar Tracker is a crypto tracking and information website that focuses on serving the end user direct and fast information about their favorite crypto currencies and crypto news without having the user jump through hoops or make an account to do so.

## Why Build Ceasar Tracker ?

Honeslty I just wanted a site that I can go to every time that's fast and reliable and that'll let me check basic crypto info.

## The Technologies Behind Ceasar Tracker

This project uses React.js as a framework, Redux for fetching API calls from RapidAPI.com, tailwind css for styling, and I dabled with the use of framer motion for some animations for the website. Kept the animations to a minimum as too much would ruin the user experience.
